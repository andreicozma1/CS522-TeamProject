## Context
This dataset is used for Face Mask Detection Classification with images. The dataset consists of almost 12K images which are almost 328.92MB in size.

## Acknowledgments
All the images with the face mask (~6K) are scrapped from google search and all the images without the face mask are preprocessed from the CelebFace dataset created by Jessica Li (https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530). Thank you so much Jessica for providing a wonderful dataset to the community.

## Inspiration
The inspiration behind creating this dataset is to create an algorithm that can directly detect is a person is wearing a face mask or not. So I've scrapped the images from google as well as from the CelebFace dataset created by Jessica Li (https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530) to make this happen.
